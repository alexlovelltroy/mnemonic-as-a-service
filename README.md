# Mnemonic Encoding Wordlist as a Service

Several weeks ago, the nice folks at [mnx.io](http://mnx.io/) wrote a fun [blog post](http://mnx.io/blog/a-proper-server-naming-scheme/) about server naming schemes.

One of the pearls of wisdom is the recommendation to use Oren Tirosh’s [mnemonic encoding project](http://web.archive.org/web/20090918202746/http://tothink.com/mnemonic/wordlist.html) as a wordlist. 

GENIUS!

I’d never heard of that particular wordlist before and immediately downloaded it and built a [shell function](https://gist.github.com/alexlovelltroy/119c32a12f6aca28c3f3) to give me a few examples for codenames.

Then, I decided I wanted my shell function available on the web through curl.

This flask service is what I built.

enjoy!
